# New favourite apps

While moving my blog posts to [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), I felt inspired to update the apps I recommended to Dan a [few months ago](/your-two-favourite-apps).

My two favourite and most used apps at the moment are Play, and HiCoffee.

[**Play**](https://apps.apple.com/nz/app/play-save-videos-watch-later/id1596506190) is a paid app by [Marcos Tanaka](https://marcosatanaka.com/) for saving and playing YouTube videos. It has a Channels Inbox ($) for subscriptions, and the ability to play videos embedded, so you get an ad-free experience, with minimal algorithmically suggested videos. It's *practically* as good as the original YouTube app for [iPhone OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_OS_1).

[**HiCoffee**](https://apps.apple.com/nz/app/hicoffee-caffeine-tracker/id1507361706) is a caffeine tracker by [Gong Zhang](https://gongzhang.io/). It's designed with fun device physics, while also providing helpful graphs and data, all for free. Calculating the metabolic rate and half-life of caffeine can be challenging, but HiCoffee makes it feel easy, with data you can trust.

Honourable mentions:

- [Debit &amp; Credit](https://apps.apple.com/nz/app/debit-credit/id882637653?mt=12), by [Ivan Pavlov](https://mastodon.social/@ivanpavlov) for continuing to be the simplest powerhouse for managing our financial future.
- [Callsheet](https://apps.apple.com/nz/app/callsheet-find-cast-crew/id1672356376), by [Casey Liss](https://www.caseyliss.com/callsheet), for being a movie data stronghold. It loads faster than [Letterboxd](https://apps.apple.com/nz/app/letterboxd/id1054271011), and doesn't have distracting social aspects; it has more data than [TV Forecast](https://apps.apple.com/nz/app/tv-forecast-shows-movies/id1454200438), and doesn't demand attention with release dates.
- [Les Mills](https://apps.apple.com/nz/app/les-mills-new-zealand/id975939557), for recently updating their app, complete with launch-day cupcakes iced with QR codes to update the app.
- [Goodlinks](https://apps.apple.com/nz/app/goodlinks/id1474335294) by [Ngoc Luu](https://goodlinks.app/) for being a better way to read [*The New Yorker*](https://www.newyorker.com/). [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/) makes me check too much.
