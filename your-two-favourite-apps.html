<h1>Your two favourite apps</h1>

<p><a href="https://dancullum.com">Dan</a> is asking about <a href="https://dancullum.com/2024/01/your-two-favourite-apps/">favourite apps</a>.</p>

<p>My two favourite apps at the moment are iA Writer, and right now I'm really enjoying Threads.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a></strong> has long been a favourite app for writing anything in plain text; from blog posts to CVs, website copy, and more. It's an incredibly simple app with hidden advanced features, like wikilinks and task lists. I use it for writing blog posts in markdown, then dragging the text file to my blog folder which uploads it to <a href="https://blot.im/">Blot.im</a> where it's published at <a href="https://natvoisey.net/">natvoisey.net</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://threads.net/">Threads</a></strong> is a new favourite, mostly due to its algorithm. Utilising the 'hide' button has made coming back to Threads in the past weeks a great experience. It's nice to have an app to open when everyone else is on their phones.</p>

<p>Honourable mentions:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://debitandcredit.app/">Debit &amp; Credit</a>, for tracking expenses and our financial future</li>
<li><a href="https://firecore.com/infuse">Infuse</a>, for playing movies from our SMB server with nice metadata</li>
<li><a href="https://reeder.app/">Reeder</a>, for RSS feeds and reading articles</li>
</ul>
