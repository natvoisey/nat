<h1>Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe</h1>

<p>The film opens on Werner talking about how destructive television is; talk shows, commercials, <em>Bonanza</em>, <em>Rawhide</em>.</p>

<p>Werner didn’t think Errol Morris would finish his film, <em>Gates of Heaven</em>, so Werner said he would eat his shoe if he did.</p>

<p>Errol didn’t think he could even <em>make</em> a film because he didn’t have any money, but Werner encouraged him:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Money doesn’t make films. You just do it and take the initiative.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This film is strangely frozen in time; linear television, free regin in airports, cash over the counter, and news from over the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Making a film in this time was a much larger risk than it is today. More people make films and videos today, yet storytelling is the same as it always has been.</p>

<p>Storytelling is a skill as old as time; video is just a consequence.</p>

<p>In line with storytelling is cooking.</p>

<p>Werner is bothered by the fact that he has <em>not</em> cooked a meal for almost an entire year:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A grown up man like me should not spend a week without having cooked a big meal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Be sure to tell stories, and cook meals.</p>
