<h1>Panic’s ‘SLOWBIZ’ with Playdate</h1>

<p>I’ve been inspired by <a href="https://gdcvault.com/play/1034707/The-Playdate-Story-What-Was">this session</a> by <a href="http://cable.com">Cabel Sasser</a> on his company <a href="http://panic.com">Panic</a>, and developing the <a href="http://play.date">Playdate</a>.</p>

<p>As everything was falling apart, this quote from his kid got me:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“You’re gonna find a way to fix this. You’ve been working on this for so many years and you’ve fixed so many problems. <strong>The world won’t let you stop here.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That 10 year old really did… <em>cook</em>.</p>

<p>I aspire to work hard and make things in front, and for my <em>own</em> family. I can’t way to show my kids what it means to make things, encourage others when they need it, and receive encouragement themselves.</p>

<p>One day I’d like to work for a company that is not seen as a ‘Garbage Tech Company’. Maybe something smaller with a team who actually knows each other, who are happy, and enjoy what they do. Maybe even a fully local team. Wouldn’t that be <em>crazy</em>.</p>

<p>But like Cabel says, “we all do what we have to do.” For now, I will understand the market I am in, the company, and the vision of the leadership. One day it would be nice to focus on people, and making great things. But today I will focus on the stock ticker, and ‘number go up’.</p>
