<h1>New favourite apps</h1>

<p>While moving my blog posts to <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>, I felt inspired to update the apps I recommended to Dan a <a href="/your-two-favourite-apps/">few months ago</a>.</p>

<p>My two favourite and most used apps at the moment are Play, and HiCoffee.</p>

<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/nz/app/play-save-videos-watch-later/id1596506190"><strong>Play</strong></a> is a paid app by <a href="https://marcosatanaka.com/">Marcos Tanaka</a> for saving and playing YouTube videos. It has a Channels Inbox ($) for subscriptions, and the ability to play videos embedded, so you get an ad-free experience, with minimal algorithmically suggested videos. It's <em>practically</em> as good as the original YouTube app for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_OS_1">iPhone OS</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/nz/app/hicoffee-caffeine-tracker/id1507361706"><strong>HiCoffee</strong></a> is a caffeine tracker by <a href="https://gongzhang.io/">Gong Zhang</a>. It's designed with fun device physics, while also providing helpful graphs and data, all for free. Calculating the metabolic rate and half-life of caffeine can be challenging, but HiCoffee makes it feel easy, with data you can trust.</p>
